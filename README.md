# Adversarial Examples For Fun And Profit
Try to generate adversarial images for fun and profit. 

![screenshot](./resources/Screenshot.png)

## What is this
You can generate adversarial images _in your browser_ by the power of tensorflow.js.

## Attacks
Currently, you can try the below attaks.
- FGSM
- DeepFool
- NewtonFool

## Issues
Currently, the implementation of DeepFool attack is slightly modified from the original paper. This is because I found that the denominator of some formulas can be so small that the perturbation is too big. I am investigating this issue.
